A simulator for a MIX computer. The MIX computer is a theoretical computer from Knuth's "The Art
of Computer Programming" that is used to implement algorithms in the book. This implementation
simulates the computer and aims to be readable and easy to maintain (at the cost of performance in places).
While there is a reasonably extensive test suite this should still be considered an "alpha" level project
at this time. The specification for writing a program that the simulator can accept can be found in
section 1.3.2 (of volume 1) of "The Art of Computer Programming".
